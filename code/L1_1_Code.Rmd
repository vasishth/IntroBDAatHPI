# Simulating a discrete random variable: the r-function

Simulate tossing a coin ten times, with probability (which I call $\theta$ below) of heads 0.5:

```{r}
extraDistr::rbern(n = 10,prob = 0.5)
```

# The probability mass function: Bernoulli 

$$p_X(x)= \theta^x (1-\theta)^(1-x)$$

where x=0 or x=1.

# What's the probability of a tails/heads? The d-function

```{r}
extraDistr::dbern(0,prob=0.5)
extraDistr::dbern(1,prob=0.5)
```

Notice that these probabilities sum to 1.

# The cumulative probability distribution function: the p-function: 

$$F(x=1) = Prob(X \leq 1) = \sum_{0}^{1} p_X{x} = 1$$

```{r}
extraDistr::pbern(1,prob=0.5)
```

$$F(x=0) = Prob(X \leq 0) = \sum_{0}^{1} p_X{x} = 0.5$$

```{r}
extraDistr::pbern(0,prob=0.5)
```
